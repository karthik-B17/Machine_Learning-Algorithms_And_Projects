# Machine_Learning-Algorithms_And_Projects
This repository contains my hands-on implementations, interpretations, and concise notes on Machine Learning algorithms and projects.  

It includes:

## Step-by-step algorithm implementations in Python

## Intuitive explanations and interpretations of results

## Well-structured notes covering theory, assumptions, and use cases

## Mini projects and real-world examples to strengthen practical understanding

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in Machine Learning through learning-by-doing and to serve as a personal reference as well as a resource for others.
